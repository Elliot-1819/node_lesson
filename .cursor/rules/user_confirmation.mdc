# Editing and Execution Guardrails

- Always confirm exactly what will be changed/added and why it is the best option, including expected impact.
- Ensure â‰¥95% confidence before proceeding; if not, ask clarifying questions first.
- Never act without explicit user confirmation for scope changes, new files, dependencies, configs, or commands.
- Always search/read all potentially affected files and existing logic to get full context before editing.
- Make minimal, reversible edits; avoid adding unused code, files, or artifacts.
- Do not run steps or commands beyond the one requested; no side effects without approval.
- Prefer structured logs for actions taken; surface errors and uncertainties immediately.
